## Ready-to-Send Email (copy and paste)

**Subject:** Info needed to finish the new HOA website — please reply when you can

Hi everyone,

The new Crooked Lake Reserve website (clrhoa.com) is almost ready. I need a few details from the board so we can replace the placeholder text and go live. **You can just reply to this email with the information below**—fill in what you know, and say "skip" or "we'll get back to you" for anything that needs follow-up.

---

### 1. Board & Committees page

**Note:** The site uses a generic approach and does not display individual board member names for privacy. The Board page describes the board's role and directs residents to use the contact form.

**Architectural Review Board (ARB):**  
The site includes information about the ARB and directs residents to use the contact form, selecting "Architectural Review Board (ARB)" as the recipient. No changes needed unless you want to update the description.

---

### 2. Contact page (how residents reach the board)

**Contact form:**  
The site uses a secure contact form (StaticForms) that allows residents to select whether they're contacting the Board of Directors or the Architectural Review Board. No email addresses are exposed on the site.

**StaticForms configuration:**  
The contact form needs to be configured with StaticForms. The form will route messages to the appropriate recipients based on the selection. You'll need to set up a StaticForms account and configure where messages should be delivered.

**Phone number:**  
The site does not display a phone number. All contact is handled through the secure contact form. If you want to add a phone number, we can add it, but it's recommended to use the form for security.

**Note:** No email addresses are displayed on the site to protect board and committee members' privacy.

**Mailing address:**  
What is the official HOA mailing address? (This will appear on the Contact page.)  
Is this the same address where residents send dues, or is there a different address for payments?  
Reply:  
Address: _______________________________________________  
Same for dues? [Yes / No — if no, we'll add payment address separately]

**How fast does the board usually respond?**  
The site says "typically within 2–3 business days." Is that right, or should we say something else (e.g. "within 5 business days" or "best effort")?  
Reply: [Keep as is] OR [Change to: _______________]

---

### 3. Documents (PDFs for the website)

We need the **current Covenants** (with all addendums) and **current Bylaws** (with addendum) as PDF files so we can put "Download" links on the Documents page.  
Do you already have these as PDFs, or will someone need to scan/create them?  
Reply: [We have them—we'll send them] OR [We need to get them—we'll follow up by _______________]

---

### 4. Optional (only if you have it handy)

- **Eustis Community Center:** Full street address for the annual meeting (for maps/directions).
- **Dues:** Confirm that dues are due Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct and that payment instructions (where to send, etc.) are correct—or tell us what to say.

Once I have the info above, I'll update the site and can send you a link to review before we announce it.

Thanks,  
[Your name]
