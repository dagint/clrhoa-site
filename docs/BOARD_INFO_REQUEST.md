## Ready-to-Send Email (copy and paste)

**Subject:** Info needed to finish the new HOA website — please reply when you can

Hi everyone,

The new Crooked Lake Reserve website (clrhoa.com) is almost ready. I need a few details from the board so we can replace the placeholder text and go live. **You can just reply to this email with the information below**—fill in what you know, and say “skip” or “we’ll get back to you” for anything that needs follow-up.

---

### 1. Board & Committees page (who to list)

**Current board members and their roles.**  
Example format (use whatever is correct for us):

- President: [Full name]
- Vice President: [Full name]
- Secretary: [Full name]
- Treasurer: [Full name]
- (Any other board members: name and role)

If you prefer **only names** (no titles), or a different format, just say how you’d like it to read.

**Architectural Review (ARC):**  
Should we list a specific contact for ARC requests (e.g. one person’s name), or keep it as “contact the board” for ARC?  
Reply: [Specific contact name] OR [Keep as “contact the board”]

### 2. Contact page (how residents reach the board)

**Email for homeowner inquiries:**  
Is **board@clrhoa.com** correct and checked regularly? If not, what email should we show?  
Reply: [Yes, use board@clrhoa.com] OR [Use this instead: _______________]

**Phone number:**  
The site currently has a fake number. What number should we publish (or should we say “contact by email only”)?  
Reply: [Phone number] OR [Email only—no phone]

**Mailing address:**  
What is the official HOA mailing address? (This will appear on the Contact page.)  
Is this the same address where residents send dues, or is there a different address for payments?  
Reply:  
Address: _______________________________________________  
Same for dues? [Yes / No — if no, we’ll add payment address separately]

**How fast does the board usually respond?**  
The site says “typically within 2–3 business days.” Is that right, or should we say something else (e.g. “within 5 business days” or “best effort”)?  
Reply: [Keep as is] OR [Change to: _______________]

---

### 3. Documents (PDFs for the website)

We need the **current Covenants** (with all addendums) and **current Bylaws** (with addendum) as PDF files so we can put “Download” links on the Documents page.  
Do you already have these as PDFs, or will someone need to scan/create them?  
Reply: [We have them—we’ll send them] OR [We need to get them—we’ll follow up by _______________]

---

### 4. Optional (only if you have it handy)

- **Eustis Community Center:** Full street address for the annual meeting (for maps/directions).
- **Dues:** Confirm that dues are due Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct and that payment instructions (where to send, etc.) are correct—or tell us what to say.

---

Once I have the info above, I’ll update the site and can send you a link to review before we announce it.

Thanks,  
[Your name]
