# Act as Board / Act as ARB — How-to for ARB+Board and Admins

This is a short, non-technical guide for **ARB+Board** members and **Administrators** who can temporarily “act as” Board or ARB from the portal.

---

## Who can use this?

- **Administrators** can assume **Board** or **ARB** (one at a time) to provide technical assistance. They normally have view-only access to Dues and ARB requests until they assume a role.
- **ARB+Board** members can switch between acting as **Board** or **ARB** (one at a time). They choose which role they are acting in when doing Board or ARB tasks.

## When to use “Act as Board” vs “Act as ARB”

- **Act as Board**  
  Use when you need to do **Board** tasks: record dues payments, manage directory, documents, meetings, vendors, and other board operations. The portal will show you the same options a Board member sees (e.g. “Record payment” on Dues).

- **Act as ARB**  
  Use when you need to do **ARB** tasks: review and approve or reject ARB requests. The portal will show you the same options an ARB member sees (e.g. approve/reject on ARB requests).

You can only be in **one** assumed role at a time. To switch, you must **drop** the current role (or wait for the timeout) before choosing the other.

---

## Drop role / Return to Admin

- **ARB+Board:** Use **“Drop role”** to stop acting as Board or ARB. You’ll return to your normal ARB+Board view and can choose “Act as Board” or “Act as ARB” again when needed.
- **Administrators:** Use **“Return to Admin (view only)”** to stop acting as Board or ARB. You’ll return to view-only access. Use “Act as Board” or “Act as ARB” again when you need to perform actions.

---

## Timeout (2 hours)

- After you assume a role, it automatically **expires after 2 hours**. The banner shows something like “Role expires in ~1h 45m.”
- When the time runs out, you’re no longer acting as that role (you’re back to Admin view-only or ARB+Board without an assumed role).
- You can **drop the role** at any time; you don’t have to wait for the timeout.
- Before assuming the **other** role (e.g. switch from Board to ARB), you must drop or wait for the current role to expire.

---

## If something doesn’t update

After you assume a role, the yellow banner updates right away. If you don’t see new options (e.g. “Record payment” or ARB approve buttons), **refresh the page** so the rest of the portal matches your current role.

---

## Actions are logged

All assume-role actions (and actions you take while acting as Board or ARB) are logged for transparency and audit. Board and Admins can review the “Admin assume role” audit section on the Audit logs page (this section is only visible to Board and Admin, not to ARB or ARB+Board).
